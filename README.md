FAO Application (Android and Desktop)
===============

Desktop and Android application for FAO Locust Watch project and Europa Challenge 2014.

This application has been donated to help FAO on the Locust Watch project (http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/en/info/info/index.html).

The goal of this application is to help FAO at providing support to national locust operators in Africa and Middle East.
Desert locusts are a huge problem for the population and due to their ability to change their behaviours and habits.
These locusts are hard to limit as they form swarms and move rapidly (about 20km/h). Moreover, they can consume (in 1km² swarm) as much food as 35.000 people eats in a single day.
